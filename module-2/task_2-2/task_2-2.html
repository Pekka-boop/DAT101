      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				[Constants are used when the number stays the same throughout the program while variables are commenly used when number changes in the program. They can't all be constants because certain numbers can change in the program.]
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[When there is a parentheses in the program, or math for that matter, the order changes so that the stuff in the parentheses is calculated first.]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[We can use the function toFixed. This does that the number is rounded up to a number we choose. Like if we use to.Fixed(2) it will round the number to 2 decimals.]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[We need to use the (==) operator.]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[They return boolean values, which can if they are TRUE or FALSE. We can check them by using if-statements.]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[Math.random() is a random number generator that chooses a random number. For example, in task 9 we used this to choose a random number between 1 and 360.]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[Modulus has an interesting function. It will show us the remainder of a division. For example if we divide 5 by 2 we get 2 with the remainder of 1. So 5 % 2 will give us 1.]
