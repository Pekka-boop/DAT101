      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>I used "if" to see what happens when they wake up at 6,7 or 8. If the wake up time isn't 7, they will either take the car or take the train. When they wake up at 7, they will take the bus</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>I used "if" to see what would happen if they were to wake up at 6,7 or 8. If the wake up time wouldn't be 7, they will either take the car or take the train. But if they were to wake up at 7, they will take the bus</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>I decided to use the "if" word to see what would occur if they were to wake up at the different times of 6,7 or 8. If they were to wake up at the times wouldn't be 7, they will either take the automobile or take the steam train. But if they were to wake up at 7, they will take the big car, known as the bus</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>At least in my program, the number 0 is zero. It's not positive or negative. But if it goes below that, it's negative while if it goes above it's positive</p>
