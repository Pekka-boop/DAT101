      <li>In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?</li>
      <p>Yes, it is possible to do it in a singular loop. You would just need to make two different variables and make different conditions for them</p>

      <li>In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?</li>
      <p>Yes, this can be done if the condition is never met</p>

      <li>Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
the program perform other tasks concurrently?</li>
      <p>The time can be different depending on how long time the program takes to guess the number. It will take a "break" for every time it starts with date.now and when it stops</p>

      <li>Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
matter?</li>
      <p>It does not matter</p>
