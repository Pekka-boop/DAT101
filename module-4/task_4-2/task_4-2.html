      <li>What is an array?</li>
      <p>As the great Arne Thomas once said, "an array is a collection of data"</p>
      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode"?</li>
      <p>It's for example when you write a list of numbers on your own instead of using a shortcut like for example using a special code that will make it easier</p>
      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.</li>
      <p>This is because javascript gives us the basic information we need with ".length"</p>
      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?</li>
      <p>It makes the general coding experience better, because of easier sorting and so on.</p>
      <li>Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task(...)</li>
      <p>The different days differ from each other because they have different values. hmmmmmmm pizza</p>
      <li>In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.</li>
      <p>Such a "callback" routine will sort everything from start to finish, so like a - b. which in this case will small to big number.</p>
      <li>What happens in the sorting routines you have created?</li>
      <p>As mention, it will automatically sort the numbers from smallest to biggest.</p>
      <li>In task 10, explain what the first element of the array contains.</li>
      <p>They both contain the number 0 since the counting starts from 0 when comes to programming. After that 1 will appear.</p>
